      <p>Hi, my name is Niko Venag and I'm a Software Developer. <br></p>
      <p>Since I was 15 years old I was always fascinated by programming and as everybody I wanted to build my own website. It always looked difficult to me since the age of 22 when I got involved in a course where I learnt the basic programming languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery etc). Since that moment I was hooked with how easy you can learn programming. </br></p>
      <p>I was introduced to programming for a first time when I was studying Biotechnology degree in the Universtity of Vic(Spain). We had Python classes where we were writing some easy scripts using random DNA sequences for a research. I have passed this subject but it was really difficult for me to understand Python(Ubuntu). I never got back again to programming till the age of 22 when I signed for a programming course and my teacher answered all my questions and I was able to connect the dots. Since this moment I was hooked. </br></p>
      <p>I have always believed that it's better to hear from somebody who is climbing the mountain than from somebody who already climbed it. </br></p>
      <p>If you want to succeed as a Software Developer you have to learn and get smarter day after day. This will not be possibe if you are not disciplined and willing to put your time into this. <br></p>
      <p>One of the most amazing things about being a programmer is that you can learn writing code without going to University. This doesn't mean that you will not have to study. But you can learn with your own speed. <br></p>
      <p>My goal with this website is to motivate and inspire you to put down time to learn, grow and make more money.<br></p>
      <p>As I'm very diverse person I will be sharing information about Cryptocurrency, Fitness, book reviews etc. My approach to life is not just to become a rich person but to become a fully developed in all aspect of life.</p>
